    name: "The Heaviness of Being",
    medium: `Acrylic on paper, 11.8" x 11.8"`,
    date: "2024",
    description: `In 2024, I made the weighty decision to leave my home and move to a new city, a choice that triggered profound inner tension. At that time, I read Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, a novel that explores the dichotomy of lightness and heaviness. Lightness represents a carefree life lacking commitment, while heaviness signifies the responsibilities that come with deep connections to others. Neither state is purely good or bad. Lightness can lead to emptiness, while heaviness can feel burdensome. Inspired by these themes, I sought to explore the concept of heaviness through my painting.\n\nThe artwork features an overall blue tone that conveys a sense of melancholy. At the centre, a girl appears to be drowning in an ocean. While the unnatural colours in the background create a sense of obscurity, she is also sinking uncontrollably into a mysterious space, with darker hues at the bottom suggesting an infinite abyss. Her posture is passive. She gazes desperately at the surface while allowing herself to fall silently, resisting the urge to struggle against her descent.\n\nThrough this creative process, I aimed to express the essence of heaviness. In reality, I wrestled with fulfilling multiple roles. I wanted to be a good daughter, caring for my family, yet I also desired to remain with my partner, who had migrated with his family. I could choose a path of lightness by committing less in my relationships, but I decided to embrace the responsibilities and bear the burden of my choice. Also, this was the first time I faced a significant decision filled with uncertainties. As I entered adulthood, I learned that every choice comes with costs. To gain something, we often must lose something else. The weight of being responsible for my own decisions left me feeling overwhelmed.\n\nWhile painting served as an emotional outlet for my heaviness, I found a sense of tranquility after contemplating the artwork for some time. I realised that blue, often associated with melancholy, also embodies calmness. This led me to question whether my perception of heaviness was too pessimistic. In truth, I began to see myself as more mature for having confronted this weight. The girl in my painting, submerged in emptiness, was just a projection of my inner turmoil. Yet, I recognised that I was not alone, as I had a robust support network strengthened by firm relationships. Although the burden in life may sometimes drag me down, I am confident in my power to rise again.\n\nWhen I later shared my artwork with friends, I was struck by their resonance with my emotions. Many agreed that transitioning into adulthood brings increased responsibility and, inherently, greater heaviness. Despite our different circumstances, we each carry our own burdens. Acknowledging the universal existence of heaviness made it feel more bearable, transforming my perspective on the experience. Eventually, I came to appreciate the power of heaviness in growth and resilience building.`,

    description: `My hometown, Hong Kong, is predominantly composed of Chinese ethnicity but was colonised by the British for a century. This unique blend of cultures has led to a complex and often confusing sense of identity. By crafting a mask with two sides, I aim to explore my identity as a Hong Kong citizen.\n\nThe front of the mask features elements that symbolise our cultural heritage and core values. Masks are common in traditional Chinese rituals to ward off evil spirits. They are also present in Chinese performance art, conveying emotions and traits through vibrant colours. The upper left part mimics the appearance of a Chinese opera character with dramatic facial painting and an intricate hairstyle. Below the left eye, a lantern represents Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival, which are celebrated collectively by Chinese communities. The plants on the left cheek signify the concept of harmony, a fundamental principle in Chinese culture. Influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, this idea emphasises our connection to nature and the importance of respecting and understanding it.\n\nConversely, the right side of the mask embodies elements representing Western influence. The gear wheel and light bulb in the upper right corner symbolise rationalism, a key value since the Enlightenment. Our education places significant emphasis on reason and knowledge, with society investing heavily in science and medicine to enhance lives in an evidence-based manner. The dove on the right cheek represents freedom. As a capitalist society, Hong Kong embraces private property and the liberty to choose from the market. Additionally, we are shaped by individualism, which values personal freedom and autonomy.\n\nAs I crafted the mask, I reflected on the values instilled in me since childhood—values that I often took for granted. I realised that conflicts exist among them. For instance, despite my reliance on reason, I still celebrate traditional festivals steeped in superstitions and myths. Although I was taught to pursue harmony with nature through a balanced life, I sometimes indulge in material pleasures. Bringing these unattended conflicts to the surface prompts me to question who I truly am.\n\nAfter finishing the front of the mask, I started crafting the back, seeking a deeper reflection of the unnoticed emotions related to my mixed identity. I created an individual whose face is covered by both hands—a reaction I would have if my mask was torn off, leaving me exposed before others. I realised that I often conceal my true feelings and thoughts due to the collectivist values upheld in Chinese communities. At school, we tend to avoid being conspicuous and fear negative judgment. This hesitation often prevents us from raising our hands, even when the answers are clear. As we grow older, we continually compare ourselves to others in terms of achievements and material possessions, with society frequently determining one's worth based on profession and productivity. The situation in Hong Kong is further complicated by politics. While many advocate for freedom and democracy, we have limited power over public affairs.\n\nThis reflection stimulates a suffocating feeling, prompting me to express my emotions through repeated patterns. The sharp stripes on the left side mirror the harsh criticisms from people around, while the swirls on the right evoke the tumultuous brushwork of Vincent van Gogh's paintings, conveying my inner turmoil. Using crafting as an emotional outlet, my unsettled feelings gradually subsided, allowing me to contemplate the mask with a sense of serenity.\n\nThe mask embodies both sides, showcasing a blend of desirable and undesirable elements, much like my complex identity. Eliminating the conflicts it presents feels impossible, and seeking a single definition of my identity seems absurd. I realised that embracing the richness of my identity is essential. I should not view the diverse influences as enemies but rather as complements to one another. Being exposed to both Eastern and Western cultures enables me to appreciate their strengths and weaknesses. It is unnecessary for me to confine myself entirely to either, I can explore alternative choices.`,

    description: `Self-portraiture is always a powerful tool for self-discovery. The creative process not only facilitates personal reflection, but also serves as an emotional outlet, helping reduce anxiety and foster healing. Research over the past decades has consistently highlighted the therapeutic benefits of creating self-portraits, affirming its role in enhancing well-being. Throughout history, many renowned artists have embraced self-portraiture for diverse purposes, from the introspective works of Rembrandt to the bold identity-exploring pieces of Frida Kahlo. I am particularly captivated by the blue self-portrait painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1889, because the swirling brushstrokes and monochromatic colours vividly convey his inner turmoil.\n\nRecognising the importance of self-portraiture, I have always wished to create my own portrait. However, this has been challenging for me, as I struggle to appreciate my appearance. During puberty, I often avoided looking in the mirror because the acne on my face triggered unpleasant feelings and lowered my self-esteem. Psychology research suggests that people tend to find symmetrical faces more attractive, yet I noticed that the right side of my face appears lower than the left. Also, while sharp contours are often preferred, my nose is rather flat, which I perceive as unattractive. Additionally, influenced by Korean pop culture, many people in Hong Kong view pale V-shaped faces with large eyes as feminine and elegant, while I was born with darker skin and smaller eyes.\n\nTo create this self-portrait, I spent hours looking in the mirror for the first time in my life. I purposefully placed a lamp to the left to enhance colour contrast and deepen shadows, allowing my facial features to be more defined. During the creative process, I paid attention to every detail of my face. Although my skin is oily and bears scars from past acne, I realised that I experience fewer breakouts now, likely due to no longer being an adolescent. My face remains asymmetrical, but I had microblading done to make my eyebrows more even and neat. While many people prefer fair hair, I chose to dye my hair and add highlights. These changes prompt me to question whether I am too dependent on others' preferences and whether these adjustments truly reflect my desires or merely societal expectations. I am uncertain if these changes are genuinely beneficial, but I can say that I feel a greater sense of self-confidence with my current appearance.\n\nWhen contemplating the self-portrait, it felt as if it was speaking to me, urging me to love myself, regardless of how others perceive my appearance. Physical appearance is just temporary, while my worth transcends it. At that moment, I found reconciliation with my appearance. `,

    name: "When My Dad Smiles",
    medium: `Oil pastel on paper and magazine collage, 11.8" x11.8"`,
    date: "2024",
    description: `Being a traditional Asian father, my dad was always strict and authoritarian, holding high expectations for me. Despite my academic achievements, he rarely praised me, choosing instead to remind me to stay humble. For many years, this dynamic created distance between us, leaving me with unresolved feelings. On the day of my university graduation ceremony, I read a letter he had written to me. In it, he shared, "Your dad did not receive much education and could not help you throughout your studies. All your achievements are the fruits of your hard work. I am so proud of you." As I read those words, I burst into tears. At that moment, I realised the depth of my inarticulate feelings towards my dad and our relationship. This revelation inspired me to explore those emotions through my artwork.\n\nAs I began the creative process, I chose oil pastel, a medium I frequently used for drawing my family as a child. This familiar material helped me recollect memories from my early days. While scrolling through my photo album for reference images, I noticed there were few pictures featuring my dad. After some time, I found an image taken seven years ago, capturing a moment after he completed a hiking event. I decided to depict that moment when he smiled genuinely.\n\nWhile drawing my dad, I focused on his expression. He is not only a traditional Asian dad but also a traditional Chinese man who often withdraws his emotions. When interacting with him, I find myself observing his reactions and guessing his thoughts, which can be quite challenging. Moreover, my dad tends to suppress his own preferences in favour of others, a trait shaped by his upbringing in a collective society. He often responds with "anything" when I ask him about his choices, yet hiking is one area where he has a strong preference. Every year, he participates in an event that requires relentless hiking over 100 kilometres. It is one of the rare occasions that brings him true joy. Additionally, I was actually present at that time, waiting for him at the finish line and cheering him on. It was one of those scarce moments when I truly felt close to him.\n\nAfter completing my dad's figure, I decorated the background with a magazine collage. The orange and blue colours symbolise his energy and calmness respectively. I created wavy lines in contrasting colours to express my ambivalence towards him. I wish for more intimacy, but I fear being rejected. I admire many aspects of my dad, such as his strength and perseverance during hikes, his humble attitude toward others, and his deep care for family. Yet, I struggle with his frequent emotional withdrawal and his hesitation to express love. I also realised that, deep down, I care for him, especially regarding his feelings. However, I find myself mirroring his behaviour, hesitating to express my own emotions to him.\n\nUpon finishing the artwork, I presented it to my dad. He responded with a brief smile and offered minimal comments. While our relationship did not change dramatically afterward, we at least acknowledged each other’s care, despite the distance that still remains between us.`,

    description: `This painting presents an ordinary view of a road from my perspective as a migrant, exploring the difficulties I experienced due to migration. I moved to Birmingham two months ago and decided to utilise art-making to express my feelings related to this experience. Initially, several subjects came to mind, such as the card reader I struggled to use when I boarded public transport for the first time and the self-checkout in supermarkets. Eventually, I chose to depict the scene of crossing a road, as it represents the overall challenges I faced.\n\nCrossing roads is an everyday action that often goes unnoticed. When I first arrived in the UK, I noticed that the traffic lights here are different from those in my hometown. There is a small box in the middle of the pole with a button for pedestrians to push. After pressing the button, the word "wait" lights up. Initially, I stood still, waiting for the traffic light to turn green, just as I would in my hometown. However, I observed that many pedestrians crossed the road when no vehicles were approaching, even if the light was still red. When I remained standing while others moved, I felt out of place. To blend in, I began to follow their behaviour, despite my worries about breaking the law and the risk of accidents. This left me feeling uncomfortable.\n\nThis experience reminds me of the concept of conformity in psychology, where individuals often change their beliefs, actions, or attitudes to align with group norms. There is a famous experiment in which participants were asked a question with an obvious answer. Despite knowing the correct answer, they changed their response when surrounded by others who deliberately gave an incorrect answer. In my case, having just arrived in a new city, I have yet to fully understand its norms and fear being judged negatively. As a result, I constantly observe how others behave and adjust my actions to fit in.\n\nDuring the creative process, I aimed to capture the tension between my instinct to conform and my desire to stay true to myself. The road represents not just a physical barrier, but also the emotional obstacles I face as a migrant. The grey colours and broad brushstrokes of the road echo the uncertainty and confusion I felt during the moments of hesitation. The creative process also allowed me to reflect on the absurdity of the situation. Those who cross the road during a red light swiftly leave the scene and pay no attention to me, while those who wait for the light do not view this behaviour as foolish. I realised it is merely my own obsession with others' perceptions that creates the discomfort. Ultimately, this painting serves as a reminder that a true sense of belonging does not come from copying others' behaviours.`,

    medium: `Clay on wood, 6" x 4"`,
    date: "2024",
    description: `One of my recurrent nightmares revolves around snakes, the objects of my unexplainable phobia. Despite never having encountered a snake in my early years, I would feel intense fear even when merely gazing at images of cartoon snakes. In my dreams, the sight of these creatures triggers a similar terror. This phenomenon combined with my interest in psychoanalysis encourages me to visualise the dream scenario, facilitating a confrontation with my feelings and providing deeper insights into myself.\n\nBefore starting this creative journey, I delved into literature on dreams, particularly Carl Jung’s Man and His Symbols. Both Freud and Jung recognised that dreams hold significant meanings and offer insights into the unconscious. While Freud emphasised that dreams express repressed desires, I found Jung’s perspective more compelling. He suggested that dreams can serve as warnings and help restore psychological equilibrium. Jung also highlighted the personal nature of dream messages, noting that interpretation must consider the dreamer’s unique context. Armed with this knowledge, I began to recreate the scenario of my nightmare.\n\nWhen crafting the sleeping human figure, I positioned it lying straight with hands resting on the chest, capturing a petrified reaction. Snakes of various lengths crawl over the body from different directions. Typically, I find reference images for my artwork, but my fear of snakes prevented me from looking at any. Instead, I crafted solely from my imagination, allowing me to focus on the tactile sensation of working with clay, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Upon completing these elements, I perceived the human figure as profoundly powerless. Imagining myself in that position, I felt an overwhelming fear, yet I would remain still, hesitant to move for fear of provoking the snakes.\n\nI began to engage in a dialogue with my craft. I wished to reassure the figure that she was safe, as it was merely a dream. Yet, this seemed ridiculous, as I fear images of snakes in real life despite knowing they aren’t real. This realisation reveals the limitations of reason and knowledge. We often strive to explain everything and seek rational solutions, yet irrational elements exist in the world. While we might view this as a weakness, I try to consider it as a strength, since our irrational thoughts can reveal truths that rationality may overlook.\n\nThen I started contemplating my perception of snakes. As other animals, like lions and tigers, can also harm humans, so why do I fear snakes in particular? Raised in Christian faith, I was taught that snakes are associated with sin and should be avoided. When I grew up, I learned that snakes can move unpredictably with their limbless bodies, while some even possess venom. Their prowess as predators left me feeling powerless. This sense of losing control likely contributes to my fear. I’ve noticed that nightmares related to snakes often arise during periods of stress, when I feel out of control. While I'm uncertain of the exact relationship, I suspect that my dreams may play a crucial role in unveiling hidden fears I struggle with.\n\nIf I encounter this nightmare again, I predict I will be frightened, but I aim to partner with it in confronting my fear rather than viewing it as an adversary. It is notable that allowing our fears to illuminate the obscurity within us may transform our nightmares into opportunities for growth.`,

    medium: `Oil on newspaper and rice, 8.3" x 5.8"`,
    date: "2024",
    description: `This painting explores my identity by illustrating the dining culture of my hometown. The background is composed of newspaper because of my family’s tradition of using it instead of tablecloths during meals. This choice reflects a practical mindset, prioritising disposability and economy over elegance. In Chinese culture, the essence of dining lies in family unity, symbolised by the circle. A round table serves as the focal point, where family members gather and share dishes placed on round plates at the centre, each using a round bowl for rice.\n\nThe elements in the painting embody our cultural heritage. Chinese people have been consuming rice for thousands of years, an essential source of energy for those engaged in intense physical labor. Despite the rapid changes in society, white Jasmine rice remains popular in Hong Kong households. It is distinct from other rice, such as Japanese rice and Biryani rice in both appearance and texture. I intentionally placed two grains of rice outside the bowl, reflecting the common occurrence of dropping rice during meals. Parents often remind their children to avoid waste and cherish every grain. This idea is also emphasised through traditional poetry that honours the hard work of farmers. The dish featured is tomato egg, a favourite among Hong Kong citizens who often return home late after long work hours. Its simplicity and quick preparation—taking only about ten minutes—make it a popular choice. Additionally, chopsticks are essential utensils in our dining experience, highlighting the importance of proper posture. When dining, we lift our bowls with our non-dominant hand while using chopsticks with our dominant hand.\n\nThroughout the creative process, I reflected on how dining habits encapsulate the collective nature of our society. The norms surrounding dining created tension to a certain extent. For instance, I remember being reprimanded by my parents for being disrespectful when I did not lift the bowl and bent my head down to eat. Similarly, not coming home on time for dinner would trigger disappointment within my family. Moreover, the whole family sitting around the table and discussing various topics sometimes lead to conflicts due to the different values held by each family member. This can be distressing for a family that emphasises collectivity. Despite the tension, dinner is an invaluable time for the family, as it is when members ask each other about their day. Families not only share food during dinner but also laughter. For me, dinner stirs more happy memories than tension.\n\nThe elements in the painting are portrayed from a top-down perspective, using stark contrasts of light and shadow which create a sense of reality. When I look at this realistic depiction of dinner, I can almost sense the heat and smell of the food, and even hear the lively chatter of my family. My feeling is amplified. I hope that viewers of this painting can grasp what a typical dinner with a Chinese family feels like, even if they come from different backgrounds.`,

    description: `When I was eight years old, I had a close-knit group of classmates whom I trusted and considered my best friends. One morning, as I entered the classroom and attempted to initiate a conversation with one of them, I was met with complete silence as if I were invisible. Over the following weeks, the entire group isolated me. Although they eventually befriended me again, the absence of an apology left me with unresolved emotions that haunted me for over a decade, often resurfacing during vulnerable moments. This experience compelled me to explore these unfinished feelings through my artwork.\n\nIn my drawing, I reconstructed the incident, depicting my friends gossiping and walking away from me in the school playground. I portrayed myself with a downcast expression and a sluggish appearance, facing away from the light. The contrasting colours in the background symbolise the tension of that moment, echoing the emotional pain I experienced.\n\nAs I created this artwork, I reflected on the complexity of the feelings involved. While we often describe such situations as "feeling isolated," I wondered if that term could truly capture the complexity of my emotions. Initially, I felt confused, unsure of what I had done to deserve such treatment. I only recognised that my behaviour might have triggered their reactions in hindsight. During group activities, I often felt embarrassed and helpless, unable to turn to anyone for support. When bullying continued for some time, I began to feel hopeless, unable to see a way out, and even feared going to school. Gradually, I internalised their views, seeing myself as worthless and unlovable. When they eventually reached out to me again, I felt a mix of relief and anger—relief at no longer being alone, but anger that they had never acknowledged their mistake. Years later, seeing their lives unfold on social media still filled me with bitterness, knowing I was still haunted by that incident while they seemed to thrive. I realised that the impact of this experience had made me anxious in later friendships, fearing a repeat of that isolation. I longed to put an end to this cycle.\n\nWhile therapists may use the empty chair exercise to help people confront their unfinished business, I chose to confront my feelings through the creative process. I expressed my emotions to my friends as if they were present. Upon completing the artwork, I looked at my figure in the drawing. I wished to comfort and reassure her that she deserved love. In viewing that vulnerable girl, I also acknowledged my growth. I had become stronger and less dependent on others. I took a moment to appreciate my transformation from trauma. Without those past injuries, I would not be the person I am today.\n\nAfter confronting my feelings, I accepted the truth that I would likely never see those individuals again or receive an apology. The past event cannot be altered, and I realised that moving forward requires me to embrace forgiveness. I reminded myself that forgiveness does not mean forgetting. While reconciliation involves both parties, forgiveness is a personal journey. By choosing to forgive, I free myself from the weight of that experience and establish a clear boundary, ensuring that it no longer has the power to harm me. This act of forgiveness allows me to pave the way for a more positive future.`,

    date: "2023",
    description: `Exploring the theme of nudity has always been my desire, especially since I didn't have the opportunity to do so when I was younger. As art historian Kenneth Clark distinguishes, being naked simply means being without clothes, while the nude is a form of art. Despite this distinction, traditional Chinese culture often views nude figures as obscene due to conservative attitudes toward sexuality.\n\nGrowing up in Asia, open discussions about sex were rare. I remember learning about the differences between males and females in kindergarten, which sparked my curiosity about sexuality. One day, I drew nude figures at home, only to be met with alarm from my mother, who urged me to depict other subjects. This experience, combined with my first visit to an art museum where I encountered nude figures in paintings, ignited my fascination with the beauty of the human body. Yet, throughout my childhood, discussions of sex and nudity remained repressed, leaving me feeling ashamed for being attracted to sexual content in newspapers or online. During puberty, I often felt embarrassed about the physical changes happening in my own body.\n\nMy perspective evolved during my time working in a hospital. There, I frequently encountered the genitals of both sexes while performing nursing tasks. I no longer viewed genitals as pornographic. Instead, I came to see them as essential parts of the human body and appreciated the beauty of figures in their entirety. Most importantly, I learned to value my own body, taking time each day to look in the mirror after bathing and observe any changes.\n\nIn this drawing, I aim to express the beauty of human figures. However, my search for reference images online was frustrating, as I encountered a predominance of erotic photos, particularly of women with large breasts, even when using "non-erotic" as a keyword. This objectification reduces women to mere tools for sexual gratification, which I found deeply concerning. Eventually, I decided to depict human figures using athlete photos for reference.\n\nDuring the creative process, the sharp contours of the body stirred memories of my anatomy studies in nursing education. Names like biceps and gluteus muscles floated into my mind. I was amazed to realise that these diverse muscles also exist within my own body, though they are often obscured by layers of fat. I deliberately left the genitals of the figures in the painting blank, as I could not find appropriate reference images. This choice serves as a silent protest against the overwhelming pornographic content in society.\n\nAfter finishing the painting, I contemplated it deeply. I appreciate the fluidity and physical fitness of the figures. Their overall presentation prompts me to reflect on societal standards of beauty concerning body sizes. Nudity has appeared in many artworks throughout history, from Botticelli's The Birth of Venus to Paul Cézanne's Bathers. I discovered an interesting fact: muscular male bodies consistently represent masculinity and are perceived as desirable. During the Renaissance, for instance, male figures were idealised with muscles and perfect body ratios. In contrast, societal preferences for female bodies have fluctuated over time. In Titian's Venus of Urbino, women with round bellies were once considered feminine and attractive, likely due to the fertility suggested by such features. Today, many people prefer women with slim waists. Despite this difference, women remain subjects of the male gaze. With the sexual features obscured, I wonder: do people still appreciate the nude figures I portray?`,

    description: `In July 2024, I visited the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum during a missionary trip and learned about Cambodia's harrowing history. This site, a former secondary school, was used as Security Prison 21 by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979, where over 20,000 Cambodians were imprisoned and tortured, many of whom were executed. Decades after the fall of the Khmer Rouge, the site remains well-preserved. The brick walls dividing the classrooms into narrow cells and the razor wire surrounding the area still stand. There are even torture devices, photographs of victims, and human skulls on display. The chilling history presented in the museum left me overwhelmed with sorrow, prompting me to explore my feelings through art-making after returning home.\n\nIn my artwork, I depicted the view of a torture room from a tilted angle. This composition disrupts the natural equilibrium of the image, fostering a sense of instability and disorientation. The square tiles on the floor capture the confined and ordered nature of the room, while the colour progression of the tiles and walls illustrates the room's depth. Moreover, the absence of any objects in the room conveys a profound emptiness and the desolation faced by the victims. A bird flying outside the window starkly contrasts with the prison's bleakness. Overall, I aimed to express the tension inherent in this space. Although I realised that the warm colour tones do not match the atmosphere, the interior of the actual site is predominantly yellowish-brown.\n\nI used collage as the medium for this artwork. Collage involves breaking original materials into pieces to create a new image, which aligns with my desire to deconstruct the distress brought on by my visit to the museum and generate new meanings. During the creative process, I came to understand that the origin of my distress is compassion. It’s not necessary for people to experience the same suffering to understand how it feels, while simply imagining oneself as the sufferer can foster empathy. Having witnessed bloodshed during protests in my hometown that advocated for democracy, I am particularly moved by the injustices in the world. This anger serves as a powerful force that drives me to support justice and pay attention to the wars occurring globally. It reminds me not to be egocentric and to remain aware of the misfortunes of others.\n\nAdditionally, collage is not a familiar art form for me compared to drawing or painting. Without the pressure of perfecting each brushstroke, I could focus more on my feelings and thoughts. I also enjoyed the tactile sensation of tearing magazine paper and sticking the pieces together. The creative process provided a sense of soothing.`,
